README for AIRS (Android Remote Sensing Platform)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the source code (and compiled APK) of the Android Remote Sensing (AIRS) platform. The platform allows for recording a variety of phone-based as well as attached sensor information. It originated from the Nokia Remote Sensing (NORS) platform which is hosted at http://sourceforge.com/projects/nors

Currently, the application server for the remote sensing part of AIRS is not yet included in the distributed - please use the NORS application server which works with AIRS!

Refer to the ReleaseNotes.txt for changes, starting from NORS

Refer to the license.txt for the GPL/LGPL license that applies for this project!
